==============

devel branch:

    [2016.3.1] January 9 2017 - Minor patch release that fixes bugs:
        (1) Correctly sets MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.8 so executable works 
            on OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and above
        (2) Fixed a parsing bug in Parameter that prevented integer or float
            parameters from being passed to ligandswap, waterswap etc.
        (3) Fixed a small bug in MultiDouble that meant it lost precision when
            swapping individual values
        (4) Fixed a parsing bug in Parameter that meant that windows path names
            were not interpreted correctly
        (5) Fixed the build scripts so that they placed bundled libraries into
            bundled/lib rather than bundled/lib64 (affected SUSE-based distributions)

    [2016.3.0] December 22 2016 - Public release containing full LigandSwap. Uses
     new optimised forcefields for energy calculations, built on top of Intel Threaded
     Building Blocks for parallelisation. New code is significantly faster with better
     scaling.

    [2016.2.0] June 3 2016 - Semi-private release for the CCP-BioSim workshops. Included
     the first version of LigandSwap and general bug fixes

    [2016.1.0] April 29 2016 - Merge of Bristol and Edinburgh codes, moved to miniconda
     and clean packaging system, including OpenMM fully, added in nautilus, somd etc.,
     added optimised forcefields, added a proper unit testing suite.


    [OLD] Updated gradient compuation in openmmfreenergst to finite differece gradients
    Allow the computation of reduced perturbed energies in openmmfreenergst of all computed lambda values
    Separated minimization and equilibration from production run.
    Implemented mass repartitioning for hydrogens atoms to allow for larger integration timesteps
    Added nautilus scripts
