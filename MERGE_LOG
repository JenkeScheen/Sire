Ran svn merge from 2677 to 2731 from devel into julien branch in corelib and python
(julien has his in python2, but it is really python)

svn merge -r 2677:2731 ../../devel .
svn merge -r 2677:2731 ../../../../python/branches/devel/ .

Now, I am going to copy the files that have changed from the julien
branch into the github directory, doing this library by library 
for corelib...

I then used the finddiff.pl script to find differences between the 
github repository and julien's branch, first using corelib,
using the command,

(CWD = github repository)
perl build/finddiff.pl . ../../../sire/corelib/branches/users/julien

This found lots of diffs. I have now merged all of the diffs and
am working through a compile. I have issues with .energy again in 
InternalFF etc. that I must fix...
