Ran svn merge from 2677 to 2731 from devel into julien branch in corelib and python
(julien has his in python2, but it is really python)

svn merge -r 2677:2731 ../../devel .
svn merge -r 2677:2731 ../../../../python/branches/devel/ .

Now, I am going to copy the files that have changed from the julien
branch into the github directory, doing this library by library 
for corelib...

I then used the finddiff.pl script to find differences between the 
github repository and julien's branch, first using corelib,
using the command,

(CWD = github repository)
perl build/finddiff.pl . ../../../sire/corelib/branches/users/julien

This found lots of diffs. I have now merged all of the diffs and
am working through a compile. All of corelib now compiles. Next
thing is to regenerate the python wrappers and merge the rest
of the python tools in...

Ok - I've now fixed the python wrapper generator so that it can
generate wrappers on any linux. Have regenerated all of the wrappers
and have then copied across all of the scripts from 2014.4 to
this one. I think that everything is now merged.
