We bundle Qt5 with Sire. We only use QtCore. To make the download small,
we remove everything that is not needed by QtCore. To do this, follow
these instructions.

1. Download the Qt5 source for module QtBase, e.g. qtbase-everywhere-src-5.12.1.tar.xz
2. Unpack, e.g. tar -jxvf qtbase-everywhere-src-5.12.1.tar.xz
3. Rename this as qtbase, e.g. mv qtbase-everywhere-src-5.12.1 qtbase
4. Remove the unnecessary files, e.g. 
   rm -rf qtbase/docs/* qtbase/examples/* qtbase/tests/*
5. Retar as qtbase.tar.gz, e.g. tar -zcvf qtbase.tar.gz qtbase
6. Remove the contents of qtbase, but leave the directory there,
   e.g. rm -rf qtbase/* ; rm -rf qtbase/.*
7. Create an empty qtbase_patch file using tar -zcvf qtbase_patch.tar.gz qtbase

8. Now try to compile QtBase by compiling Sire... cd Sire; ./compile_sire.sh

If this works, then everything is ok. That is unlikely though...

To debug a Qt compile issue, edit install_qt5.cmake and comment out
the lines that read "OUTPUT_QUIET ERROR_QUIET"

This will un-silence the Qt configure and build, enabling you to debug issues.

If there are any files that need patching, copy them into the right
location in the (now empty) qtbase directory, and then recreate
the qtbase_patch.tar.gz file. This file will be untarred over qtbase.tar.gz,
enabling your fixes to be applied without us needing to change or
modify qtbase.tar.gz (important to keep file sizes down, and also so
that we have a good record of what needs changing). Your changes should
*ONLY* be to ensure that Qt5 can compile on your computer. It should not
change base functionality. Typically, we only need changes to cope
with new OS releases (e.g. updated OS X!)

(for example, I needed to create the empty directory tests/auto/cmake)
