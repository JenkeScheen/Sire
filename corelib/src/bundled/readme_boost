The boost_headers.tgz file is a tarball of boost 1.54

This was generated using the "bcp" utility that comes with boost.

To generate this file, download boost, cd into the boost source
directory and then type;

./bootstrap.sh

cd tools/bcp/

../../bjam

This will create the "bcp" utility in the boost bin directory
(on my mac, this is bin.v2/tools/bcp/darwin-4.2.1/release/link-static/bcp)

I copy this file into my path.

== Now, to generate the file boost_headers.tar.gz needed by corelib ==

To generate the list of needed boost header files, type

mkdir tmp
bcp --scan /path/to/corelib/src/libs/*/* --boost=/path/to/boost_1_54_0/ ./tmp

This will copy all of the header files into tmp/boost

Simply tar this up and you have the file :-), e.g.

cd tmp
tar -zcvf boost_headers.tar.gz boost
cp boost_headers.tar.gz /path/to/Sire/corelib/src/bundled

== Now, to generate the file boost_python.tar.gz needed by wrapper ==

You will need a new tmp directory, e.g. tmp2

mkdir tmp2
bcp -scan /path/to/wrapper/*/* --boost=/path/to/boost_1_54_0/ ./tmp2

This will copy all of the header files into tmp2/boost and the
boost python source into tmp/libs/python/src

Now, we need to prepare a directory called boost_python

cd tmp
mkdir boost_python
mkdir boost_python/build
mv libs/python/src boost_python
mkdir boost_python/src/include
mv boost boost_python/src/include

This will now have created a self-contained boost_python directory with
an empty "build" directory, and then a "src" directory that contains the
boost python source, plus a "src/include" directory that contains all of
the necessary boost/python header files.

The next step is to copy in the template CMakeLists.txt file that is
contained in the Sire/wrapper/bundled/template_boost_cmake.txt so
that it is in boost_python/src/CMakeLists.txt

cp /path/to/Sire/wrapper/bundled/template_boost_cmake.txt boost_python/src/CMakeLists.txt

Next, edit this CMakeLists.txt file to ensure that all of the .cpp files
that are contained in boost_python/src are listed, e.g.

cd boost_python/src; ls -1 *.cpp */*.cpp; cd -

will list all of the files. Ensure these are all included, e.g.
by copying and pasting them into place.

Finally, tar up the boost_python directory and place it into the
wrapper directory

tar -zcvf boost_python.tar.gz boost_python
cp boost_python.tar.gz /path/to/Sire/wrapper/bundled/boost_python.tar.gz
